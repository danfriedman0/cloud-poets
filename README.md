# Cloud Poets

Cloud poets are computer poets that generate metered verse. This is an ongoing project. Right now (11/4/2016) there are two kinds of cloud poet: The cmu directory has scripts to generate rhyming poems by using the CMU pronouncing dictionary. The nn directory has scripts for training a recurrent neural network to produce verse. The text directory has some text files that can be used for training the neural net or generating Markov chains (for the CMU poets). The util directory has some scripts for pulling text from gutenberg.org.

Check back for updates. Right now the poets are not great, but over time they will learn and develop their craft.
